# MoveTool has moved!
MoveTool's new repository is here: https://github.com/DoctorBearPhD/MoveTool

# MoveTool
A tool that outputs JSON files from Street Fighter 5's BCM, BAC and BCH (uasset) files and rebuilds those files from JSON.

## How to use
Drag Uasset or JSON files on top of MoveTool.exe

## Todo
Find out what all the values means and fix remaining BAC files. Se Bugs below.
Many values are probably read in the wrong format (short/int etc).

## Bugs
Unit test shows that MoveTool is not able to recreate these files:
  Not correct length: BAC_B59
  Bytes does not match up: BAC_CMN Position: 21C Original was: 0 Created was: 1C
  Not correct length: BAC_EFE
